# OPL and CPL Voting System

## Introduction
The Voting System is designed to analyze the votes of two types of elections: Open Pary List and Closed Party List. The Open Party List method, which will be referred to as OPL, allows for people to vote for a certain candidate. The seat winners are determined by popular vote.
Closed Party List (CPL) voting allows a person to vote for a party, rather than a specific candidate. Within each party, the candidates have a predetermined ranking that determines who gets seats if they are won. The goal of the Voting System is to quickly and accurately determine the winners of an election given an input file that contains the data it requires.

## Design

## How to Install
This program requires the use of both Java and C++, meaning that you must have both the Java SDK and the GNU compiler running g++ version 7.4.0. Running on a CSELabs machine should be sufficient since it has all the dependencies.
