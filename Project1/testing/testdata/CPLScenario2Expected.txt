There are 16 votes, so the threshhold to award a seat is 11/5,
which evaluates to about 3 after ceiling. The 'D' and 'R' parties
are guaranteed 1 seat. 'G' should also get a seat since it has the
highest remainder. The last two seats are given by a series of
tie-breakers.

Guaranteed seats:
D - 1
R - 1
G - 1
I - 0

Seats randomly assigned: 2
