There are 26 votes, so the threshhold to award a seat is 26/7,
which evaluates to about 4 (should always ceiling it). The 'R'
party should get two seats, then the 'G' party should get two
seats, and the 'D' party should get one seat. There are two seats
remaining and the 'D', 'R', and 'I' parties have the same number
for the remainder, which is 2. A coin flip is done and then the
winner gets a seat. Another coin flip is done between the remaining
two to assign the last seat. Seats should be assigned by respective
ordering of the party.

Guaranteed seats:
D - 1
R - 2
G - 2
I - 0

Seats randomly assigned: 2

The program should first calculate the threshhold in order to
get a single seat, which is number of votes divided by number
of seats available. Then any party that satisfies the threshhold
gets the amount of seats for each time they reach the threshhold.

The parties with the highest remainders get the remaining seats.
Coin flip is done if there is a tie in distributing remainders.
