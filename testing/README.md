# Voting System Testing

## How to run tests
Testing should be able to run without extra downloads since Google Test is in the root directory of the repository. In order to run, you must navigate to the *testing* directory. Assuming you are in the repo's root directory, use the command:

`cd Project1/testing`
or
`cd Project2/testing`

depending on what you're looking for.

Then call make:

`make`

Then call the executable:

`./vote_unittest`

You can run the system tests by running the executable created in the *Project2/src* directory and use the scenarios created in the *Project2/testing/testdata* folder.
